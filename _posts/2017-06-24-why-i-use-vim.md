A lot of different reasons are exist out there to address why developer use Vim for their development job. I use vim for evertyhing that requires me to type on a plain text file. From writing a ruby code on my daily job at [Bukalapak](https://www.bukalapak.com), writing this blog post, to make a [Vim ebook](https://agung-setiawan.com/bukuvim), I use Vim almost on anything.

If others have their own reason. Here's mine with simple background.

I used to be a non touch typing person. Everytime I wrote code I felt sucks because my hand movement on top of keyboard was painful. It was terrible and having to use mouse everytime I wanted to mouse cursor made it worse. Another combo, I work for Bukalapak in which full of plenty great people which I thought (turns out no) were touch typer and do dance their fingers on keyboard. If I were the only one that sucks, the feeling would make me more sucks, for being the dumbest person on a band.

Then I learned how to type using 10 fingers the correct way using help of [keybr.com](https://keybr.com). At the time it felt amazing that finally I could type efficiently. Thus made me realize that should be a better way to use text editor on writing computer code. By better I mean my fingers still sit on the keyboard and no need to move some inch to touch arrow keys or keyboard.

Lucky me. At that time my friend regularly showing off his vim skill on facebook and that made me interested on learning vim since he was persistencely blaberring.

I managed to learn Vim and it is match with my needs that is an efficient way to write code while my fingers are still on top of keyboard all the time. Yes, yes I know, power user of each editor can do about the same. The difference for me is, I learn how to do it first on Vim and still not yet invest time to learn how to code efficiently on other editors.

Now everytime I use other text editors like Sublime I will wondering how to do this in Sublime text the way I do it in Vim.
