Hello there. My name is Agung Setiawan, currently I'm a software engineer on a well known marketplace in Indonesia called [Bukalapak](https://bukalapak.com). I really like writing and regurarly producing new content on [my blog](http://agung-setiawan.com) in Indonesian language and that's why I decided to make another blog and use english instead.

Why use **brandalz** as a domain name you may ask and what does it mean?. Well, I want a domain name that's not so hard to be pronounced by most of the people. By mentioning most of the people I mean western people since yeah you know this world seems like being dominated by the west, I'm sure you know what I'm talking about. So having a domain name with my own name will be hard to remember, at least that's what I thought so here I am.

In short, brandalz is a slang for *berandal* which I use google translate has a meaning of hooligan. This may heard negative but it can be meant other.

What I use in my daily job :

- Ruby
- Ruby on Rails
- MySql
- ElasticSearch
- Mongodb
- Vim
