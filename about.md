Hello there. My name is Agung Setiawan, currently I'm a software engineer on a well known marketplace in Indonesia, [Bukalapak](https://bukalapak.com). I really like writing and regurarly producing new content on [my blog](http://agung-setiawan.com) in Indonesian language and that's why for this time I decided to make another blog and use english instead.

What I use in my daily job :

- Brain
- Ruby
- Ruby on Rails
- MySql
- ElasticSearch
- Mongodb
- Vim

Judging from the list above, I will mainly writing about Ruby and of course Rails, vim and programming in general.
